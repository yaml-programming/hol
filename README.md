[YAML] is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages.

Embedded mathematical tools for all programming languages.

> YAML represents any native data structure using three node kinds: sequence, mapping and scalar - any datum with opaque structure presentable as a series of Unicode characters.
>
> Combined, these primitives generate directed graph structures

Category Theory provides several tools to interpret graphs, such as the [Quiver] category.

> a functor F:Quivâ†’Cat is an embedding

which is exactly what we look for in an embedded language.

We work with high level concepts without defining a new language syntax, even avoiding parsers altogether.
